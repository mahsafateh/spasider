# 🕵️ Spy & Insider

**Spy & Insider** is a mobile party game built with React Native that blends logic, deduction, and creativity. Designed for group play, this game challenges players to identify the hidden Spy among them through strategic two-choice questions and bluffing.

## 🎮 Game Overview

Spy & Insider is ideal for groups of 3 or more players. One player is randomly selected as the **Spy**, and the rest are **Insiders** who receive a secret word. The Spy must blend in without knowing the word — while Insiders try to subtly expose the Spy without giving away the secret.

## 🧩 How to Play

### 1. **Choose a Category**
- Players select a word category (e.g., Food, Jobs, Animals).
- Thousands of words are built-in and accessible offline.

### 2. **Assign Roles**
- Input the number of **Spies** and **Insiders**.
- ✅ **Recommended ratio**: **1 Spy for every 5 players** for balanced and engaging gameplay.
- Tap **Start** to distribute roles.

### 3. **View Your Role**
- **Insiders** receive the secret word.
- The **Spy** gets no word — only the challenge to blend in.

### 4. **Question Rounds**
- Players take turns asking creative two-option questions (e.g., “Is it soft or hard?”).
- Insiders answer based on the word; the Spy must bluff convincingly.

### 5. **Vote**
- After 1–2 rounds of questions, players vote on who they suspect is the Spy.
- Correct vote = Insider victory. Incorrect = Spy wins.
